# Learn Go With Tests

### In this section we'll write more strong code by interfaces

This is quite different to interfaces in most other programming languages. Normally you have to write code to say My type Foo implements interface Bar

* `Interface` must implemented when you have more then `struct` and each struct have same method

## Note that `the bigger the interface the weaker the abstraction`
