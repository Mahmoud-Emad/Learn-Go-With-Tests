# Learn Go With Tests

### I like to adding my steps of my learning way with go-lang.

* 1 - [Install Go-Lang from the official page](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* 2 - Prepare your text editor, I'm using VS-Code
* 3 - You're ready to coding ^^



###### Note:

* Every folder contains its README file to explain what we gonna do
